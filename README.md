# Lifecycle-Prediction-UsingMachine-learning-
Prediciton of life cycle assement impact by machine learning and data science 

This is the mini-independence project I had done around three weeks as a undergraduate short-time researcher at University. This idea comes from the research paper Application of Life Cycle Assessment and Machine Learning for High-Throughput Screening of Green Chemical Substitutes(https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c02211).

I use the same approarch mentioend in the research paper,but this time I use the different machine learnign algorithm as well to compare the accuracy.

Life cycle assessment impact is the time-counsuming process , hence it is impossible to get all of life cycle assesment impact values of millions compound avaliable in the chemical process. Application of black-box approachs like deep learnign or machine learning may give a light on estimating the life-cycle impact of unknown compound.

The database used in this project mainly comes from the small molecule organic compound, the dataset contains wide varieties may improve the accuracy of estimation
